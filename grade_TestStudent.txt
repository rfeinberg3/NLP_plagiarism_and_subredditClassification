	On the second voyage, with his ship beset by storms south of Cape Horn, Hatley shot an albatross, an incident immortalised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his poem, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.
	 Born in 1685 in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, Hatley went to sea in 1708 as part of Woodes Rogers's expedition against the Spanish.
	 Rogers circumnavigated the world, but Hatley was captured on the coast of present-day Ecuador and imprisoned in Lima, where he was tortured by the Inquisition.
	 He was released and returned to Britain in 1713.
	 Hatley's second voyage, under George Shelvocke, was the source of the albatross incident, and also ended with his capture by the Spanish.
	 As Hatley had, at Shelvocke's direction, looted a Portuguese vessel on the coast of Brazil, the Spanish this time held him as a pirate, though ultimately they released him again, deciding that Shelvocke was the more culpable party.
	 Hatley returned to Britain in 1723, and hastily sailed to Jamaica to avoid trial for piracy.
	 His fate thereafter is unknown.
target sentence: On the subsequent voyage, with his ship assailed by tempests south of Cape Horn, Hatley shot an albatross, an occurrence deified by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his poem, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

	Much of what is known about Hatley's subsequent life is in connection with the two privateering voyages that he made to the Pacific coast of South America.
	 Privateers were men who sailed in armed merchant ships carrying letters of marque from their government authorising them to plunder foreign enemies, keeping any profits for themselves and their ships' owners.
	 The first such voyage made by Hatley was under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers during the War of the Spanish Succession, which found Britain and Spain on opposing sides.
	 In 1708, at the age of twenty-three, he signed on as third mate (a junior officer position) of the Duchess, the smaller of Rogers's two ships, the other being the Duke.
	 Rogers's vessels were then being readied in Bristol for a long and difficult journey to the Pacific coast of South America.
	 The purpose of the Rogers expedition was to go around Cape Horn into the South Pacific, to damage Spanish settlements and interests along the South American Pacific coast, and to capture booty for their own profit, including the large treasure galleons that sailed from Manila to Mexico.
	 The two ships were to be crammed with men, supplies to maintain them, and with guns and powder, for the success of the expedition depended on being able to outfight those vessels they sought to capture and plunder.
target sentence: Privateers were men who cruised in outfitted dealer boats conveying letters of marque from their administration approving them to loot outside foes, keeping any benefits for themselves and their boats' proprietors.

TESTING ON INPUT PROBLEM:
sentences:
	The process begins as two continents (different bits of continental crust), separated across a tract of ocean (and oceanic crust), approach each other, while the oceanic crust is slowly consumed at a subduction zone.
	 The subduction zone runs along the edge of one of the continents and dips under it, raising volcanic mountain chains at some distance behind it, such as the Andes of South America today.
	 Subduction involves the whole lithosphere, the density of which is largely controlled by the nature of the crust it carries.
	 Oceanic crust is thin (~6 km thick) and dense (about 3.
	3 g/cm³), consisting of basalt, gabbro, and peridotite.
	 Consequently, most oceanic crust is subducted easily at an oceanic trench.
	 In contrast, continental crust is thick (~45 km thick) and buoyant, composed mostly of granitic rocks (average density about 2.
	5 g/cm³).
	 Continental crust is subducted with difficulty, but is subducted to depths of 90-150 km or more, as evidenced by ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphic suites.
	 Normal subduction continues as long as the ocean exists, but the subduction system is disrupted as the continent carried by the downgoing plate enters the trench.
	 Because it contains thick continental crust, this lithosphere is less dense than the underlying asthenospheric mantle and normal subduction is disrupted.
	 The volcanic arc on the upper plate is slowly extinguished.
	 Resisting subduction, the crust buckles up and under, raising mountains where a trench used to be.
	 The position of the trench becomes a zone that marks the suture between the two continental terranes.
	 Suture zones are often marked by fragments of the pre-existing oceanic crust and mantle rocks, known as ophiolites.
target sentence: Subduction includes the entire lithosphere, the thickness of which is to a great extent constrained by the idea of the covering it conveys.

	Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of Plautus, which contain snippets of everyday speech, indicates that a spoken language, Vulgar Latin (termed sermo vulgi, 'the speech of the masses', by Cicero), existed concurrently with literate Classical Latin.
	 The informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti.
	 However, philologists have found traces of this seldom written language in the earlier works and drafts of William Shakespeare's many plays.
	 One of the examples most prominent is in one of Shakespeare's first drafts of Titus Andronicus, where Shakespeare referred to the villain of the play as a 'adipem pullum'.
	 (Fat chicken.
	) As it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically.
	 On the contrary, romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of Romance languages.
	 The decline of the Roman Empire meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about Late Latin, a postclassical stage of the language seen in Christian writings of the time.
	 It was more in line with everyday speech, not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses.
target sentence: One of the models most unmistakable is in one of Shakespeare's first drafts of Titus Andronicus, where Shakespeare alluded to the antagonist of the play as an 'adipem pullum'.

	Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed.
	 The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base.
	 Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations.
	 It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies.
	 Without the institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity, medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion: for example, in classical Latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive, which are compound tenses.
	 Medieval Latin might use fui and fueram instead.
	 Furthermore, the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular.
	 Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail.

	+1 for the sn30 pro. it's perfect for MM2 and I love it for botw (even play on pc with cemu). 

The only thing that has happened to mine is since playing MM2 the "b" button eventually began sticking. It got to the point where the WR's I was losing I couldn't reclaim!! 

Here's what I did to fix it: you can simply take the pad for the buttons off and rotate it 180. You will need to trim a little off the other corner (you'll see what I mean if you attempt it), but once you get it done it works perfect. I was worried that because I flipped the pad the "x" button would start sticking, but that's not the case. 

Plus, the only game where I need to hold "x" a lot is Super Metroid. And I claw grip super metroid and hold "x" literally the whole game. After a few runs through it, no sticking yet.

For real. I set myself out to make easy levels and it's very hard to break 30% completion rate while making it remotely interesting.   


I made a really easy level based around 3D worlds' bumpers where you're not really supposed to die. I managed to get the completion rate to 80% but somehow some people managed to get the 500 second timer to run out in the 2nd "challange" in the level (jumping on three bumpers to get to the other side, I even had a smaller "challenge" of doing that with one bumper so people would understand you have to hold jump for a high jump).

	Here’s the thing. With enough practice, many people could play in the MLB. I think there is a very small percentage of Mario players that posses the patience and time to dedicate that much practice to beat this level.

I thought that was just when you died. I personally find the level boring due to how easy it is but if you're getting bored because it's too easy you probably can run through it in 30 seconds so I doubt it's because they're leaving or getting distracted.

	Doing a kaizo course is not even comparable to the MLB. Doing a kaizo course is more comparable to hitting a pitch from an MLB pitcher. If that's your goal, putting in some hours with that pitcher will get you there easily. That's not to say that your average will be any good, but you will manage to make contact. 

Think about how many people can actually do kaizo courses compared to the amount of people that have played MM. It's far greater than the amount of kids playing baseball to make it into the MLB. You are giving people that have achieved a victory in MM too much credit for their skills. It doesn't take that much practice to beat a simple Kaizo map.

	Learning a song on an instrument is a pretty fair analogy to beating a Kaizo level--both in terms of the type of skill/activity it is, and the difficulty.

	I actually did consider it because I watched one of Mark Brown's videos and he mentions it. Most of my levels are made with no running in mind.

I made one level where you need to run at some point but I added "Hold Y to run" in the description and made it so you can't get past the 1st obstacle without running. The platforming required running at points but it's still pretty straight foward. Even then the clear rate was low.

	Yeah it probably does. I just checked and the clear rate dropped to 66.6%. I have 2 new Xs right at the start of the stage, it looks like some people can't figure out how to get through the first challange of doing a high jump on a bumper or something about the level made them quit right when they got in (if anyone is interested I'll send the link).

I don't do troll levels. I don't have traps at the start of the stage. This isn't a particularly long level either.

This is a completely different message than talking about skill gap. Now you are saying laziness prevails, and while it might statistically be true, actively putting effort into something instantly places someone outside of the largest group of people set to fail. You might as well be saying to not encourage people to try, because most people are most likely lazy and lack patience. The person you originally responded to even said it would only test their patience, so assuming OP has patience like he said is required, OP will prevail. He doesn't have to train his whole life for the MLB either. I'm guessing a good week could get him this level.

Standing on CP2 triggers an off-screen ON/OFF switch.

The point of the competition is that people make something during the competition period - it's in the rules; entrants are supposed to be less than 33% done when the competition starts. Sorry if that's an inconvenience. We might have longer-running competitions or competitions that allow previously-completed builds in the future, though.

	I'm going to play devil's advocate here: you totally could make a hurricane bolter in three months - or, at least, a very good storm bolter. 

A bolter could be fabricated relatively quickly by fabricating it out of sheep PVC, which [is not hard to make](https://torukmakto4.blogspot.com/2019/03/bulk-pvc-sheet-themoforming-easy-way.html), as a bolter's design features many flat surfaces. 3D printing has many advantages as a method of manufacture, but it is not good at making large things quickly - and that fact is surely at least partially responsible for why your bolter build took so long.  

You could re-use almost all of the design elements of your existing bolter's firing mechanism, to avoid the the risk of needing to spend time on fiddling and experimentation. 

It'd be a lot of work, sure - it wouldn't be as impressive a competition entry if it wasn't - but still doable in three months.

I know that "knockoff" darts are pretty much a necessity, but what's the general consensus on off-brand *blasters?* I see Adventure Force blasters right next to Nerf on the shelves, but can't help but think they just look like a cheap knockoff. We bought one bolt-action "sniper" rifle, and while it does preform pretty decent, it also just *feels* cheap, almost hollow. I plan to add weights, maybe give it a more matte paint job later.

Dummy batteries are recommended in conjunction with IMRs (by anyone still recommending 14500 IMRs, which *should* be no one in this day and age because they're not appropriate or safe) because those provide significantly higher voltage than alkaline AAs (the reason they're not a good idea is that while they provide voltage in spades, they don't provide enough *current*) - if you try to push 14.8v through a toy-grade blaster designed and rated for 6v, you're going to burn it out very very quickly.

There is zero reason to use a dummy batter with Eneloops or other NiMH batteries, as they have a lower nominal voltage than alkaline chemistry (that's actually higher than what alkalines are providing across most of the discharge cycle as they sag far less) so you're never exceeding the voltage the blaster was designed to take - put as many of those in as the blaster is designed for.

Also, yes. Death to all ARs. It is a must to zorch them if you use a long barrel of course, but even with a dart-length barrel, they push out worn foam and cause malfunctions, and they do cause a flow loss and waste energy. They are a toy safety feature that we don't need in our hobby (to stop kids from shooting marbles). If your piston needs an impact pad or bumper O-ring, then make sure one is present and you won't break anything.

TESTING ON INPUT PROBLEM:
	The terminal itself isn't going to fail. Worse things are done to PCB traces in power applications. Especially where there is a wire attached, that's a heatsink and it will allow a high current density in a small bit of metal without it melting. What you would worry about first is the nylon insulator, which doesn't LOOK like glass filled nylon, so it would probably flow out of the way and eventually cause a short if the terrminal consistently runs smoldering hot. But then that likely implies a continuous current that would definitely cook any armature.

But those terminals are awful. We should have abandoned Mabuchi FK architecture years ago and started specifying TPD style (like XP180 and many high-end RC motors) brushgear.

These have much less fragile terminals, the brush/terminal are a tool-free externally replaceable unit, the commutator is bigger and more rugged, the terminals aren't the axially most protrusive thing on the end of the motor (so wire routing is better in tight fitments) and the endbell is not metal and there is no sharp can edge trying to cut wire insulation. Oh, and also, the brushgear is not rotationally biased, as each motor has 2 anti-tangent brushes, which probably helps with the issue FKs can have with rotation direction causing uneven wear and speed mismatch.

If we're going to keep on using DC technology and the 20.4mm flatcan format for the next decade, then maybe we should be switching over to that can/endbell design.

	~~N-Strike-era and Elite-era blasters have radically different AR designs. IIRC, Elite air restrictors are a lot more efficient, so more power is actually sent to the dart. You might get marginal increases, but it can definitely shorten the life of your blasters.~~

~~N-strike era ARs are, conversely, very inefficient, and often slapped on top of older reverse-plunger systems. Even on direct plungers, however, they seriously impede performance.~~

~~This is all from memory and it's literally been like, 7-ish years since we first got elite blasters so, I might be wrong.~~

~~EDIT: Elite repaints/re-releases are kind of the outlier, if your blaster is a repaint of a N-Strike era blaster, you may want to look into knocking out the ARs.~~

>What kind of impact pad do you use? I'm not interested in decreasing my MTBF for a sub-10% increase in initial velocity, so I'm really interested in this.

Depends entirely on the app. If it can accept a flat or gasket-style one, a circa 1/4" thick foam rubber (this does *not* mean EVA foam! EVA foam will pack down paper thin and rock hard with constant force on it) pad, such as weatherstripping foam. Low-durometer rubber sheet can also be used. If it's a Retalioid or designed to use a molded rubber bumper (like the ones for Retalioids) or an O-ring, I would be using that. These should also probably just get a piston/cylinder kit from Worker or such right off the bat because the stock parts are plain weak, though years ago I ran them and never had any issue. If it's a Hammershot it has a bumper built into the hammer linkage. If it's a Swarmfire, a small square of sheet rubber at the end of the track in the back of the receiver, which I guess is also an opportunity for aoe adjustment though I never did either on swarmies.

Tobias Elof posts here sometimes and he has a piece on there that is beautiful called Miriam (I’m a sucker for harmonics), and I think he also does lessons/tabs but I’m not sure about the details. I also really like Conor Berry on YouTube, he makes tabs for a lot of popular songs and they show on the lessons on YouTube or you can join his patreon and have full access to a bunch of tabs you can print.

	Learning ukulele is a time commitment. Put in the hours to learn the chords and practice them.

I don't sing either, never liked to do it. It's okay to try different learning styles until you find one that works for you.

I personally don't like YouTube tutorials, so ukulele for dummies was my go to.

	The long answer is that music is like language in that way it conveys emotions, a message or some story, but we may think it’s based on logic and therefore need to structure it like that.... but it will never be logical like language is never logical - except for Esperanto. 

Short answer is I have no clue why I choose to play my fingers like I do, but I like it. And if I don’t like it I try not to play it.

	Yes, and yes. Just do a search on Youtube for ukulele tutorials. Some popular artists/channels that do tutorials (with a focus on beginners) are Cynthia Lin, Bernadette Teaches Music, The Ukulele Teacher, and *lots* others. The Ukulele Site also has beginner lessons.

Once you reach a more advanced level though, you'll likely benefit from lessons so I do recommend them eventually. But you can get pretty far with the free content available, as long as you practice and keep pushing yourself.

	Yes! With zero musical experience and zero music theory under my belt, I bought a uke 1 year and 9 months ago. Click on my name to see a video I just posted. It’s not great but a lot better than when I started.

That being said, you'll progress faster, and without developing any bad habits, with a private teacher. Even just a friend who plays uke can help. You can learn by yourself, but no, you can't learn everything.

	I’m more interested in the community rather than being an officer.. Honestly if I had to choose between reenlisting and being a Ct or going swo.. I’d pick Ct.. Thats not to knock swo its just not what I want to do. But the acceptance rate being higher is what my officer recruiter said aswell

Again what I’m concerned about is being able to cross rate later on either during my first contract or sometime afterwards via a re-enlistment package or Ocs package. I definitely plan on taking the dlab again though but theres a 6 month hold

	Oar was low sitting around a 45, undergrad gpa was a 3.4 however I plan on improving my package by going to gradschool during/ After my first contract. I’m going for a ms in GIS and I haven’t decided on the other masters program. Either way I have a Gi bill to use so I plan on using it. My gpa is low because I had to work full time through my undergrad and there were time where work had to be a priority over academics..
CORRECT OUTPUT:
YOUR OUTPUT:
	newToTheNavy
Correct!


TESTING ON INPUT PROBLEM:
	Cross rating is unlikely. You can apply for IWO from any rate, Just make sure you really impress on your interviewers your interest and knowledge of the career. The board would be hard pressed to choose you over a competing CT for the role. A more likely path might be commissioning as a SWO first and then switching to Intel of CWO. 

Good luck with whatever you choose, but I recommend finding a way out of the AC contract if you want to be in IW.

	There are no special SO recruiters. You go through any recruiter to determine your eligibility for the Navy in general, then you would have to qualify for SO based on your mental aptitude and medical profile. Finally, you would go through a tryout period (typically takes months) to earn a contract. The most common route is to go through MEPS to pick a backup job in case you don't make the cut, then start trying out for spec ops during biweekly workouts. The workouts are tough.

As for LASIK/PRK, no the navy won’t pay for your surgery so you’ll have to fork that out of pocket. As for being a good candidate for eye surgery, that’s a discussion for your eye surgeon.

Probably not, they might be able to tell you things for the military overall, but they don't handle specifics when it comes to passing a flight physical

	I struggled with swim quite a bit. I had to do remedial swim (at API), going twice a day for two weeks straight to learn the strokes and to not be so skittish around the water. I’m happy to tell you that the instructors there work with you and help you get to where you need to be. 

When I got to the Physiological side of things at API and started doing all of the other water survival training (full gear + G-suit swim, tread and float,etc), the training I had in remedial absolutely helped me; but I couldn’t have gotten there without admitting I suck at swimming (70 min. mile swim) and just letting the instructors do their thing, teach me, and understand the water isn’t that bad. If you get rolled during the first day to go to remedial then you won’t get penalized. 

They understand that not everyone is a good swimmer and they’ll address it. At OCS, if you fail the swim test, they’ll just make you go to remedial lessons a few weeks later with more one-on-one instruction to make sure you pass.
